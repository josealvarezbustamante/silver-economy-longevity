## 🚀 Project Overview
As the global population shifts toward an older demographic (**Silver Economy**), understanding aging beyond chronological years is vital. This project treats the human body as a complex system to identify "Biological Resilience"—the ability to maintain homeostatic stability despite metabolic or age-related stressors.

## 🔬 Scientific Approach
Moving beyond linear correlations, this study utilizes:
* **NHANES 2017-2018 Dataset**: A gold standard in population health data.
* **Feature Engineering**: Integration of cardiovascular, metabolic, and lifestyle markers.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Comparison between Logistic Regression and Random Forest to capture non-linear biological interactions.

## 📈 Key Findings
* **Lifestyle as a Stabilizer**: Incorporating physical activity and smoking history improved the model's predictive power (F1-Score) by **28%**.
* **The Resilience Signature**: Direct HDL Cholesterol and Physical Activity were identified as primary drivers of health stability in individuals over 60.
* **Precision**: The final model identifies "Gold Subjects" (resilient outliers) with a precision 3x higher than random baseline.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
* **Environment**: Jupyter / Antigravity.

## 💼 Business Impact
This methodology provides a framework for:
1. **Insurance Risk Assessment**: Identifying low-cost, high-stability segments in aging populations.
2. **Longevity-Tech**: Developing "Biological Age" monitors based on non-invasive lifestyle data.
